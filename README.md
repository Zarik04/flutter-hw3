A new Flutter project for homework 3.

My Project has 6 basic dart files 4 of which are just screen pages. 
To run this program you have to clone the project files and open the folder as a project in any editor that supports the Flutter project.

I used Navigator and routes to change screens in the app. I initially saved all routes in main.dart and set the Login Page for initial route.
I have one extra NavBar.dart file with the navigation bar widget, which I used on other pages by importing it. 
Pages are changed by pressing one of the buttons on the navbar, which then calls an onPressed() function.
Inside that function, I have specified separately for each button to push the name of each route in main.dart.
